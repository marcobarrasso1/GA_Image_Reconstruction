## Intro

Genetic algorithm implementation to approximate a target image by composing it with simple geometric shapes such as triangles, circles, rectangles, lines and characters.
It iteratively change the properties of the shapes (how many, position, color, size) to minimize the difference between the reconstructed image and the original target image.
